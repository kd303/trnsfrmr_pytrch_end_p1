## the data representation & Data generation Strategy

In the solution the approach that is considered is extending the ```MNIST``` class from ```torchvision.datasets```, overriding the getitem method to generate a random number using ```random.randrange``` to generate a random number between 0 and 9. And it returns a image_data, label and random number as well as the sum generated by random number 
Refer to ```MyDataset``` class which extends the MNIST and used in DataLoader


## how you have combined the two inputs (basically which layer you are combining)

must mention how you are evaluating your results 
must mention "what" results you finally got and how did you evaluate your results
must mention what loss function you picked and why!
training MUST happen on the GPU
