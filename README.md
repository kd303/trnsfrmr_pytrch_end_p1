# This Repository contains the assignments and code produce during [TSAI's](https://theschoolof.ai/) course

- A repository of assignments from The school of AI - END 3.0 Phase 1 classes
- Lot of images and problem statements are as provided by TSAI's and images, code taken from other sources I have tried giving due credit, pls point out if I may have mistakenly either not properly given the credit or missed out all together, you can send an email or raise an issue, I will be happy to fix
- Take whatever you want its free as in helium baloon, except where sources mentions specific licensing.
- If you are taking problem definitions, Give credit to [The School of AI](https://theschoolof.ai/)
